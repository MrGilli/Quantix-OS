# The Quantix Operating System!

Like cool low-level projects? Check out Quplexity on github! Its a fast, lightweight, modular Quantum Computing Simulation library written in x86 and ARM64 Assembly.

##For Arch Based systems put the following line of code at the start of kernel.c & console.c!! ( #pragma GCC optimize ("no-stack-protector") )

# Objective
QuantixOS is a UNIX-Like operating system written in x86 Intel Assembly and C. QuantixOS aims to be the standard operating system for quantum computers, and an efficient way to interface with and manipulate qubits in a quantum computers system

# Commands
Supported commands/features:
  * A basic file system
  * Terminal/CLI based system
  * help(lists all system commands.)
  * mkfile(makes a file with specified text)
  * ls(lists files in directory)
  * clear(clears text on screen)
  * exec(execute a program (not fully working))
  * login system for ROOT.
  * IO
  * cpuid(System Info)
